# Werewolves

An app to manage your game of `Loup garous de thiercelieu` also known as `The Werewolves of Millers Hollow`.

Read about the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow).

## Why ?

Managing a game of `Werewolves` is a complicated task for the `narrator` (The game master), it requires memorizing the role of each player, the weird interactions and the actions performed by each one of them. It could be manageable for a small group of players (7-10), but when we cranck up the number, we need to have a pen and a paper to avoid messing up the game, and for this reason, I decided to create an application.

## Roles

The currently verified working roles (french version):

-   `Protector (Salvateur)`
-   `Werewolf (Loup garou simple)`
-   `Father of Wolves (Loup père infecte)`
-   `Witch (Sorcière)`
-   `Seer (Voyante)`
-   `Knight (Chevalier)`
-   `Hunter (Chasseur/Barbier)`
-   `Judge (Juge)`
-   `Captain (Capitaine)`
-   `Villager (Simple villageois)`
-   `Black Werewolf (Loup noir)`
-   `Garrulous Werewolf (Loup bavard)`
-   `Shepherd (Berger)`

_Note : This version of the game does not inherit all the rules from the original one, some abilities are changed/altered due to some limitations._
